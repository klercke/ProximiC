ProximiC: A C-based Bluetooth proximity detection suite

ProximiC (pronounced prox-ihm-ih-cee) is a personal project made to solve the most minor oof issues: turning on a light when I'm in my office. This project is very much a WIP, but I will be documenting it as if it is a real piece of software nonetheless.

Dependencies:
To make ProximiC, you will need the BlueZ library for C (-lbluetooth). A Makefile is provided. ProcimiC has been tested on the Arch Linux Kernel version 5.8.14, but should work on any kernel based on Linux 2.6.7 or newer.
